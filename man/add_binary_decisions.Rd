\description{
Add a binary decision to a project prioritization \code{\link{problem}}.
This is the conventional decision of either prioritizing funding
for a management action or not.
}
\details{
Project prioritization problems involve making decisions on
  about which management actions should be funded or not. Only a
  single decision should be added to a \code{ProjectProblem} object.
  If no decision is added to a problem then this decision class will
  be used by default. Currently, this is the only supported decision type.
