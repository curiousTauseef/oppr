\description{
Set the objective of a project prioritization \code{\link{problem}} to
maximize the chance that at least one feature will persist into the future,
whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified
budget. This objective is conceptually similar to maximizing feature
richness (i.e. \code{\link{add_max_richness_objective}}), except that this
objective tends to favor solutions which spread resources across
many features---instead of triaging features---because each feature is
treated as an independent "backup". Furthermore, weights can
also be used to specify the relative importance of conserving specific
features (see \code{\link{add_feature_weights}}).
}
\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
  project prioritization problem.
  Here, the maximum persistence objective seeks to find the set of actions
  that maximizes the chance that at least a single feature (e.g.
  populations, species, eco-systems) will persist into the future, whilst
  ensuring that the total cost of the actions remains within a pre-specified
  budget. Let \eqn{I} represent the set of conservation actions (indexed by
  \eqn{i}). Let \eqn{C_i} denote the cost for funding action \eqn{i}, and
  let \eqn{m} denote the maximum expenditure (i.e. the budget). Also,
  let \eqn{F} represent each feature (indexed by \eqn{f}), \eqn{W_f}
  represent the weight for each feature \eqn{f} (defaults to zero for
  each feature unless specified otherwise), and \eqn{E_f}
  denote the probability that each feature will go extinct given the funded
  conservation projects.

  To guide the prioritization, the conservation actions are organized into
  conservation projects. Let \eqn{J} denote the set of conservation projects
  (indexed by \eqn{j}), and let \eqn{A_{ij}} denote which actions
  \eqn{i \in I}{i in I} comprise each conservation project
  \eqn{j \in J}{j in J} using zeros and ones. Next, let \eqn{P_j} represent
  the probability of project \eqn{j} being successful if it is funded. Also,
  let \eqn{B_{fj}} denote the enhanced probability that each feature
  \eqn{f \in F}{f in F} associated with the project \eqn{j \in J}{j in J}
  will persist if all of the actions that comprise project \eqn{j} are funded
  and that project is allocated to feature \eqn{f}.

  The binary control variables \eqn{X_i} in this problem indicate whether
  each project \eqn{i \in I}{i in I} is funded or not. The decision
  variables in this problem are the \eqn{Y_{j}}, \eqn{Z_{fj}}, and \eqn{E_f}
  variables.
  Specifically, the binary \eqn{Y_{j}} variables indicate if project \eqn{j}
  is funded or not based on which actions are funded; the binary
  \eqn{Z_{fj}} variables indicate if project \eqn{j} is used to manage
  feature \eqn{f} or not; and the semi-continuous \eqn{E_f} variables
  denote the probability that feature \eqn{f} will go extinct.

  Now that we have defined all the data and variables, we can formulate
  the problem. For convenience, let the symbol used to denote each set also
  represent its cardinality (e.g. if there are ten features, let \eqn{F}
  represent the set of ten features and also the number ten).

 The objective (eqn 1a) is to maximize the probability that at least one
 feature will remain---given the probability that each feature will
 become extinct---plus the probability each feature will remain multiplied
 by their weights (noting that the feature weights default to zero).
 Constraint (eqn 1b) limits the maximum expenditure (i.e.
 ensures that the cost of the funded actions do not exceed the budget).
 Constraints (eqn 1c) calculate the probability that each feature
 will go extinct according to their allocated project.
 Constraints (eqn 1d) ensure that feature can only be allocated to projects
 that have all of their actions funded. Constraints (eqn 1e) state that each
 feature can only be allocated to a single project. Constraints (eqn 1f)
 ensure that a project cannot be funded unless all of its actions are funded.
 Constraints (eqns 1g) ensure that the probability variables
 (\eqn{E_f}) are bounded between zero and one. Constraints (eqns 1h) ensure
 that the action funding (\eqn{X_i}), project funding (\eqn{Y_j}), and
 project allocation (\eqn{Z_{fj}}) variables are binary.

 Although this formulation is a mixed integer quadratically constrained
 programming problem (due to eqn 1c), it can be approximated using
 linear terms and then solved using commercial mixed integer programming
 solvers. This can be achieved by substituting the product of the feature
 extinction probabilities (eqn 1c) with the sum of the log feature extinction
 probabilities and using piecewise linear approximations (described in
 Hillier & Price 2005 pp. 390--392) to approximate the exponent of this term.
