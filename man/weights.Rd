\title{Weights}
\description{
Weights are used to specify the relative importance for specific
features persisting into the future. Please note that only some
objectives require weights, and attempting to solve a problem that does not
require weights will throw a warning and the weights will be ignored.
}
\details{
Currently, only one function can be used to specify weights:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_feature_weights}}}{
    Set feature weights for a project prioritization \code{\link{problem}}.}

  }
}
\examples{
#TODO
