\title{Add a random solver}
\usage{
add_random_solver(x, number_solutions = 1, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} object.}

\item{number_solutions}{\code{integer} number of solutions desired.
Defaults to 1. Note that the number of returned solutions can sometimes
be less than the argument to \code{number_solutions} depending on the
argument to \code{solution_pool_method}, for example if 100
solutions are requested but only 10 unique solutions exist, then only 10
solutions will be returned.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} should information be printed while solving
optimization problems?}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} object with the solver added
  to it.
}
\description{
Specify that solutions should be generated using random processes. Although
prioritizations should be developed using optimization routines,
a portfolio of randomly generated solutions can be useful for evaluating
the effectiveness of solutions.
}
\details{
The algorithm used to randomly generate solutions depends on the
 the objective specified for the project prioritization
 \code{\link{problem}}.

 For objectives which maximize benefit subject to budgetary constraints
 (e.g. \code{\link{add_max_richness_objective}}):

 \itemize{

 \item All actions are initially selected for funding (excepting actions
   which are locked out).

 \item An action is randomly selected and defunded (excepting actions which
   are locked in or actions which have zero cost).

\item The previous step is repeated until the total cost of the remaining
  actions that are prioritized for funding is within the budget.

 }

For objectives which minimize cost subject to biodiversity constraints
(i.e. \code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}:

 \itemize{

 \item All actions are initially not selected for funding (excepting actions
   which are locked in or actions which have zero cost).

 \item An action is randomly selected for funding (excepting actions which
   are locked out.

\item The previous step is repeated until all of the persistence targets
  are met.
