\title{Specify the type of decisions}
\description{
Project prioritization problems involve making decisions on how
actions will be funded. If no decision is explicitly added to a
\code{\link{problem}}, then binary decisions will be used by default.
}
\details{
Please note that only one type of decision is currently supported:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_binary_decisions}}}{Add a binary decision to a
    project prioritization \code{problem}. This is the classic decision of
    either funding or not funding an action. If no decision is added to a
    problem object then this decision class will be used by default.}
