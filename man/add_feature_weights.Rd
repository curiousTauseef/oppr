Set feature weights for a project prioritization \code{\link{problem}}.

\details{
Weights are used to specify the relative importance for
  maintaining the persistence of different features. For budget constrained
  problems (e.g. \code{\link{add_max_richness_objective}}, these weights
  could be used to specify which features are more important than other
  features according to evolutionary or cultural metrics. Specifically,
  features with a higher weight value are considered more important. It is
  generally best to ensure that the feature weights range between 0.0001 and
  10,000 to reduce the time required to solve problems using integer
  programming. As a consequence, you might have to rescale the feature
  weights if the largest or smallest values occur outside this range
  (excluding zeros). If you want to ensure that certain features conserved
  in the solutions, it is strongly recommended to lock in the actions for
  these features instead of setting really high weights for these features.
  Please note that a warning will be thrown if you attempt to solve
  problems with weights when an objective has been specified that does
  not use weights. Currently, all objectives---except for the minimum
  set (i.e. \code{\link{add_min_set_objective}} and the
  the maximum expected phylogenetic diversity (i.e.
  \code{\link{add_max_phylo_div_objective}}) objectives---can use weights.

  The weights for a problem can be specified in several different ways:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{numeric}}{\code{vector} of weight values for each feature.}

  \item{\code{character}}{specifying the name of column in the
    feature data (i.e. the argument to \code{features} in the
    \code{\link{problem}} function) that contains the weights.}
