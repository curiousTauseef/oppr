\description{
Set targets for a project prioritization \code{\link{problem}} by
specifying exactly what probability of persistence is required
for each feature. For instance, setting an absolute target of 10\%
(i.e. \code{0.1}) corresponds to a threshold 10\% probability of persisting.
}
\details{
Targets are used to specify the minimum probability of persistence
  for each feature in solutions. For minimum set objectives
  (i.e. \code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}, these targets
  specify the minimum probability of persistence required for each species
  in the solution. And for budget constrained objectives that use targets
  (i.e. \code{\link{add_max_target_phylo_objective}} and
  \code{\link{add_max_target_richness_objective}}), these targets
  specify the minimum threshold probability of persistence that needs to be
  achieved to count the benefits for conserving these species.
  Please note that attempting to solve problems with objectives that require
  targets without specifying targets will throw an error.

  The targets for a problem can be specified in several different ways:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{numeric}}{\code{vector} of target values for each feature.
    Additionally, for convenience, this type of argument can be a single
    value to assign the same target to each feature.}

  \item{\code{character}}{containing the names of columns in the
    feature data (i.e. the argument to \code{features} in the
    \code{\link{problem}} function)that contain persistence targets.}

  }
