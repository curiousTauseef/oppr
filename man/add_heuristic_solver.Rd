\title{Add a heuristic solver}
\usage{
add_heuristic_solver(x, number_solutions = 1, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} object.}

\item{number_solutions}{\code{integer} number of solutions desired.
Defaults to 1. Note that the number of returned solutions can sometimes
be less than the argument to \code{number_solutions} depending on the
argument to \code{solution_pool_method}, for example if 100
solutions are requested but only 10 unique solutions exist, then only 10
solutions will be returned.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} should information be printed while solving
optimization problems?}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} object with the solver added
  to it.
}
\description{
Specify that solutions should be generated using a backwards step-wise
heuristic algorithm (inspired by Cabeza \emph{et al.} 2004,
Korte & Vygen 2000). Ideally,
solutions should be generated using exact algorithm solvers (e.g.
\code{\link{add_rsymphony_solver}} or \code{\link{add_gurobi_solver}})
because they can guaranteably identify optimal solutions (Rodrigues & Gaston
2002).
}
\details{
The specific algorithm used to generate solutions depends on the
 the objective specified for the project prioritization
 \code{\link{problem}}.

 For objectives which maximize benefit subject to budgetary constraints
 (e.g. \code{\link{add_max_richness_objective}}):

 \enumerate{

 \item All actions are initially selected for funding (excepting actions
   which are locked out).

 \item The next step is repeated until (i) the number of desired
   solutions is obtained and (ii) the total cost of the remaining
   actions that are selected for funding is within the budget.

 \item Each of the remaining actions that are currently selected for
   funding (excepting actions which are locked in or actions which have zero
   cost) are evaluated according to how much the performance of the
   solution decreases when the action is deselected for funding, relative to
   the cost of the action. This can be expressed mathematically as:

   \deqn{B_l = \frac{V(L) - V(L - l)}{C_l}}{B_l = (V(L) - V(L - l)) / C_l}

   Where \eqn{L} is the set of remaining actions currently
   selected for funding (indexed by \eqn{l}), \eqn{B_l} is the benefit
   associated with funding action \eqn{l}, \eqn{V(L)} is the objective
   value associated with the solution where all remaining actions are
   funded, \eqn{V(L - l)} is the objective value associated with the
   solution where all remaining actions except for the action \eqn{l} are
   funded, and \eqn{C_l} is the cost of action \eqn{l}.

   The action with the smallest benefit (i.e. \eqn{B_l} value) is then
   deselected for funding.

 }

For objectives which minimize cost subject to biodiversity constraints
(i.e. \code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}):

 \enumerate{

 \item All actions are initially selected for funding (excepting actions
   which are locked out).

 \item The next step is repeated until (i) the number of desired
   solutions is obtained or (ii) no action can be deselected for funding
   without the probability of any feature expecting to persist falling below
   its target probability of persistence.

 \item Each of the remaining actions that are currently selected for
   funding (excepting actions which are locked in or actions which have zero
   cost) are evaluated according to how much the performance of the
   solution decreases when the action is deselected for funding, relative to
   the cost of the action. This can be expressed mathematically as:

   \deqn{B_l = \frac{\big(\sum_{f}^{F} P_f(L) - T_f \big) -
   \big( \sum_{f}^{F} P_f(L - l) - T_f \big)}{C_l}}{
   B_l = ((sum_f^F P_f(L) - T_f) - (sum_f^F P_f(L - 1) - T_f)) / C_l}

   Where \eqn{F} is the set of features (indexed by \eqn{f}),
   \eqn{T_f} is the target for feature \eqn{f}, \eqn{L} is the set of
   selected for funding (indexed by \eqn{l}), \eqn{C_l} is the cost of
    action \eqn{l}, \eqn{B_l} is the benefit
   associated with funding action \eqn{l}, \eqn{P(L)} is probability
   that each feature is expected to persist when the remaining actions
   (\eqn{L}) are funded, and \eqn{P(L - l)} is the probability that
   each feature is expected to persist when all the remaining actions except
   for action \eqn{l} are funded.

   The action with the smallest benefit (i.e. \eqn{B_l} value) is then
   deselected for funding.
