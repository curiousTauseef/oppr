Targets are used to specify the minimum probability of persistence required
for each feature. \strong{Please note that only some objectives require
targets, and attempting to solve a problem that requires targets will throw
an error if targets are not supplied, and attempting to solve a problem that
does not require targets will throw a warning if targets are supplied.}
