\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum probability of persistence required
for each feature. \strong{Please note that only some objectives require
targets, and attempting to solve a problem that requires targets will throw
an error if targets are not supplied, and attempting to solve a problem that
does not require targets will throw a warning if targets are supplied.}
}
\details{
The following functions can be used to specify targets for a
  project prioritization \code{\link{problem}}:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_relative_targets}}}{
    Set targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the maximum probability
    of persistence associated with the best project for feature. For
    instance, if the best project for a feature has an 80\% probability of
    persisting, setting a 50\% (i.e. \code{0.5}) relative target will
    correspond to a 40\% threshold probability of persisting.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_absolute_targets}}}{
    Set targets for a project prioritization \code{\link{problem}} by
    specifying exactly what probability of persistence is required
    for each feature. For instance, setting an absolute target of 10%
    (i.e. \code{0.1}) corresponds to a threshold 10\% probability of
    persisting.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_manual_targets}}}{Set targets manually.}
