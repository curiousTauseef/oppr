\title{Problem objective}
\description{
An objective is used to specify the overall goal of a project prioritization
\code{\link{problem}}. All project prioritization problems involve
minimizing or maximizing some kind of objective. For instance, the decision
maker may require a funding scheme that maximizes the total number of
species that are expected to persist into the future whilst ensuring that
the total cost of the funded actions does not exceed a budget.
Alternatively, the planner may require a solution that ensures that
each species meets a target level of persistence whilst minimizing the cost
of  the funded actions.

\strong{Please note that failing to specify an objective before attempting
to solve a problem will return an error.}

The following objectives can be added to a conservation planning
  \code{\link{problem}}:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}}{Minimize the cost of the
    solution whilst ensuring that all targets are met. This objective is
    conceptually similar to that used in \emph{Marxan}---except that
    decisions are made on funding actions instead of purchasing areas
    for conservation.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_persistence_objective}}}{Maximize the probability
    that at a single feature will persist into the future.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_phylo_objective}}}{Maximize the expected
    phylogenetic diversity of the features.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_richness_objective}}}{Maximize the expected
    species richness of the features. In other words, maximize the total
    number of species that are expected to persist.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_target_phylo_objective}}}{Maximize the
    phylogenetic diversity of the features, and counting only the
    phylogenetic contributions of features that meet persistence targets.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_target_richness_objective}}}{Maximize the
    expected species richness of the features, and counting only the
    species which meet persistence targets.}
